# Air Quality Analysis of New York City

This project analyzes air quality in New York City, focusing on Ozone (Oâ‚ƒ), Nitrogen Dioxide (NOâ‚‚), and Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5). It examines pollutant emissions (e.g., SOâ‚‚, NOâ‚“, PM2.5), associated health outcomes (e.g., asthma ER visits, hospitalizations), and annual vehicle miles traveled. The analysis is performed using R and includes data cleaning, visualization, and time series forecasting using the ARIMA model.

 # Data Source
The dataset contains surveillance data on air quality in New York City, highlighting the spatial and temporal variation in pollutant levels and exposure risks. Air pollution poses serious environmental and public health threats, especially in urban areas. Exposure to common pollutants is linked to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and premature death. These indicators help evaluate pollution trends and disparities across NYC neighborhoods.
